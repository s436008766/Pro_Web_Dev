        This website form was built as a project for the advanced web development course at UQU computer science department.
        The idea for this website is to take any kind of database and display it in a controlled container to allow users to browse, edit and delete entries on tables.
        My refrences are: What I was taught during the course, W3 Schools and Stack Overflow.
